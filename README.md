# Mastering Akka

This is the code repository for [Mastering Akka](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-akka?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=Repository&utm_campaign=9781786465023), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## Instructions and Navigations

All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, `chapter02`.

The code will look like the following:
```json
{
    "firstName": "Chris",
    "lastName": "Baxter",
    "email": "chris@masteringakka.com"
}
```

You will need a computer (Windows or Mac OS X) with Java 8 installed on it. You will need
to have Simple Build Tool (`sbt`) installed on that computer as well. This book also leverages
Docker, with the installation of Docker being covered in more detail in Chapter 1, Building
a Better Reactive App.
